## PyCitySchools Analysis ##

## Overview ##
This project involves analyzing school data using Pandas and Jupyter Notebook to generate a comprehensive report. The report includes various metrics and insights about schools in a local government area (LGA). The analysis covers the following aspects:
- LGA Summary
- School Summary
- Highest-Performing Schools
- Lowest-Performing Schools
- Maths Scores by Year
- Reading Scores by Year
- Scores by School Spending
- Scores by School Size
- Scores by School Type

### LGA Summary ###
The LGA summary provides a high-level snapshot of key metrics:
- Total number of unique schools
- Total students
- Total budget
- Average maths score
- Average reading score
- % passing maths
- % passing reading
- % overall passing

### School Summary ###
The school summary includes key metrics for each school:
- School name
- School type
- Total students
- Total school budget
- Per student budget
- Average maths score
- Average reading score
- % passing maths
- % passing reading
- % overall passing

### Highest-Performing Schools ###
- The top 5 highest-performing schools based on % overall passing are displayed in descending order.

### Lowest-Performing Schools ###
- The bottom 5 lowest-performing schools based on % overall passing are displayed in ascending order.

### Maths Scores by Year ###
- The average maths score for students of each year level (9, 10, 11, 12) at each school is calculated and displayed.

### Reading Scores by Year ###
- The average reading score for students of each year level (9, 10, 11, 12) at each school is calculated and displayed.

### Scores by School Spending ###
School performance is broken down based on average spending ranges (per student). The following metrics are included:
- Average maths score
- Average reading score
- % passing maths
- % passing reading
- % overall passing

### Scores by School Size ###
School performance is broken down based on school size (small, medium, or large). The following metrics are included:
- Average maths score
- Average reading score
- % passing maths
- % passing reading
- % overall passing

### Scores by School Type ###
School performance is broken down based on school type. The following metrics are included:
- Average maths score
- Average reading score
- % passing maths
- % passing reading
- % overall passing

### Observable Trends ###
- Trend 1: Charter Schoolsâ€™ Performance: Charter schools tend to have higher percentages of students passing both maths and reading compared to district schools. For example, Cabrera High School, a charter school, has a high overall passing percentage of 91.33%, while Bailey High School, a district school, has an overall passing percentage of 54.64%.
- Trend 2: Impact of School Size on Performance: Smaller schools generally show higher overall passing percentages compared to larger schools. For instance, Holden High School, with 427 students, has an overall passing percentage of 89.23%, whereas larger schools like Bailey High School, with 4976 students, have a lower overall passing percentage of 54.64%.

**These trends suggest that school type and size may play a significant role in student performance.**
